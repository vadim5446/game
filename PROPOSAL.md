# Hangman

## Project Description 
My app is called Hangman. It is a game app for players who want to play Hangman online. A player can join the game online and play a round of Hangman.
The scores are kept automatically and game results are displayed at the end of each round.
The player will either win or loose after the alocated number of guesses.
Users will have the option to play again.

## Pseudocode

```javascript
// 1) Define any variables used to track the state of the game:
//  A randomly generated word.
//  The given word.
//  Correct guesses. 
//  Incorrect guesses.
//  Parts of the Hangman.
//  Win or lose massege.
//  We'll need a reference to a DOM element to display messages.
//  current letter 
//  limit of the number of guesses


// 2) Define the required constants:
//  An array of randomly generated words.

// 3) Handle a player clicking a button.
//  once clicked capture the letter

// 4) LOOP Compare the player choice to the computer choice, and check for a match.
//   compare current letter to the randomly generated word
//   As long as there are guesses remaining, continue the game.

// 5) Render a win/lose message to the player. 
//    Clearly indicate who won.
